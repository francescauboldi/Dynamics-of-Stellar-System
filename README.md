## Introduction
This project was developed as part of the final examination for the course *Dynamics of Stellar Systems*.  
It focuses on the study of the dynamical evolution of galactic disks embedded in static dark matter halos, using numerical simulations and detailed orbital analysis.

---

## Project Objectives
- Study the equilibrium evolution of a stellar disk in a static dark matter halo.
- Analyze the onset and development of bar instability under non-equilibrium conditions.
- Simulate the behavior of a satellite orbiting within the galactic potential and compute the required **Δv** (delta-v) for orbit maintenance.

---

## Repository Structure
The repository contains the following files:
- `Equilibrium_System.ipynb`: Initialization of the equilibrium stellar disk configuration and treecode simulation.
- `Equilibrium_Visual.ipynb`: Visual analysis of the equilibrium system (Lagrangian radii, bar strength, energy conservation, angular momentum).
- `Propulsion and Orbital Evolution in Galactic Disks.ipynb`: Study of a test satellite's orbital evolution and propulsion needs.

## Simulation Data
Due to file size constraints, the full simulation outputs (treecode outputs, particle snapshots, etc.) are hosted externally.  
You can access all the data via the following Google Drive link:

## Simulation Framework
The simulations were performed using a customized version of a **treecode** algorithm.  
The gravitational potential includes:
- The particle disk (computed via the tree algorithm)
- A static Hernquist potential representing the dark matter halo.

---

## Conclusions
The project successfully demonstrated:
- The stability of a galactic stellar disk under equilibrium conditions.
- The structural changes induced by bar instability in the non-equilibrium case.
- The orbital behavior and propulsion corrections needed for a satellite embedded within both stable and unstable disk environments.
